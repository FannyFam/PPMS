# Project Portfolio Management System PPMS - Version 1A

### Common Problems
1. Project request (aka "demand‚Äù) is commonly recorded in excel, SharePoint or outdated application with no integration with other project management functions.   
2. Requestor or PM need to update the same demand information in different systems        
3. Approval process and status reporting are inefficient with emails, powerpoint,  standalone chat apps or forums with the same information presented in different forms.
4. High amount of unproductivity efforts & administrative cost to kick-off or deliver projects

### Benefits of PPMS
- Enable collaboration and fast decision making on Project Request (aka "demand")
- Allow data retrieval or data auto-populate in subsequent project management function in the same application 
- Improve user experience and operation efficiency
